# Collection-Buttons

## This repo aims to collect buttons from different users that can be later used by anyone in their projects.

### How to contribute -

* Fork this repo
* Create a directory with your name 
* Include an index page and style page and design your button
* Make a PR

### That's it you are done. I'll  compile it into one page at the end of this month.

## Happy Coding :)
